        <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
        <h2>Returns</h2>
        <p>Our refund policy lasts 5 days. If 5 days have passed since your purchase, unfortunately, we cannot offer you a refund or exchange.</p>
        <p>To be eligible for a refund, your request must be made within 5 days of the original purchase date. The following conditions must be met:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The service or subscription must not have been used for more than 5 days.</li>
            <li>The refund request should be made through the registered email associated with the purchase.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Certain types of services are exempt from being refunded:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Services that have been fully used, such as hosting plans activated for more than 5 days.</li>
            <li>Any transaction fees, such as domain registration or SSL certificates.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Additional Non-Refundable Items</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Domain registration and renewal fees</li>
            <li>SSL certificate services</li>
            <li>Any third-party services such as website builder tools, if not part of the free trial</li>
            <li>Subscription upgrades or renewals that have been processed</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Refund Process</h2>
        <p>Once your refund request is received and verified, we will notify you by email regarding the approval or rejection of your refund. If approved, the refund will be processed and a credit will be automatically applied to your original payment method, typically within 5-7 business days.</p>

        <h2>Late or Missing Refunds (if applicable)</h2>
        <p>If you have not received a refund yet, please take the following steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Check your bank account again.</li>
            <li>Contact your payment provider or credit card company, as there may be some processing time before the refund is officially posted.</li>
            <li>Contact your bank, as it may take time before the refund appears in your account.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you still have not received your refund after following these steps, please contact us at 'support@gosite.in' </p>

        <h2>Sale Items (if applicable)</h2>
        <p>Only regular-priced subscriptions may be refunded. Unfortunately, sale items, such as discounted hosting plans, cannot be refunded.</p>

        <h2>Exchanges (if applicable)</h2>
        <p>We do not offer exchanges for services. However, if you encounter any technical issues with our services or hosting, please contact us at 'support@gosite.in' so we can resolve the issue or provide an alternative solution.</p>

        <h2>Gifts</h2>
        <p>If the service was marked as a gift at the time of purchase, the refund will be credited back to the gift giverâ€™s account.</p>

        <h2>Shipping Costs</h2>
        <p>Since we provide digital services, no shipping charges are involved. However, please be aware that the processing fees associated with domain registration or SSL certificates are non-refundable.</p>

        <h2>Cancellation and Account Termination</h2>
        <p>If you wish to cancel your subscription before the end of the billing cycle, we will provide a prorated refund based on the unused portion of the service. If your service has been used during the billing period, no refund will be provided.</p>

        <h2>Shipping and Return Address</h2>
        <p>Since our services are digital, there is no physical address for returns or exchanges. For refunds or cancellations, please reach out via email at support@gosite.in</p>
